# Calculator Console Application

This repository contains a small project developed during a fundamentals course on C#. The project is a calculator implemented in C# that operates via the console.

## Course Overview

The Fundamentals of C# course provided a foundational understanding of the C# programming language. As part of the course, a calculator project was developed to showcase basic programming concepts and techniques using C#. The calculator operates within a console environment.

## Features

- **C# Programming**: Learn fundamental concepts of the C# programming language.
- **Console Application**: Develop a calculator that operates via the console.
- **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: Implement addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations.
- **Console Input/Output**: Utilize console input/output mechanisms to interact with the calculator.

## Prerequisites

Before running the Calculator Console Application, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- .NET 5 SDK or later: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download
